    "# Digital Filter Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital filters are a key element of DSP and they are implemented using only Multiply-Add (MAC) operations, and delays. Their role in a DSP system is to attenuate certain bands of frequencies within a signal, while letting the other frequency bands pass through unchanged. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main algorithms for digital filter design, Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR). Typically, FIR filters are preferred for many applications because they are more stable, are easier to implement on restricted hardware, and can achieve linear phase (more on this later). For these reasons, we will concentrate on the design of FIR filters only.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many FIR filter design tecniques available to DSP engineers, all producing filters with varying characteristics. In this notebook we will look at some of the most common techniques, and understand the differences between them."

    "An FIR filter convolves an input signal with an impulse response, and can be mathematically expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y(k) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h_n x(k-n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is the input signal, $k$ is the sample index, and $h$ expresses the samples (coefficients) of the impulse response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impulse responses change the shape of a signal which causes certain frequencies to be attenuated when convolved together. When we design filters, the output of the algorithms we use are the coefficients of these impulse responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "An impulse response though is a time-domain representation and would be extremely difficult (if not impossible) to determine the effect an impulse response would have on an input signal by simply looking at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the figure below shows two impulse responses; one attenuates high frequencies, the other attenuates low frequencies. Can you tell which one is which? If so, can you tell which frequencies each one will pass and which it will attenuate? And by how much?\n",

    "- **Stopband attenuation** is the measure of how much the unwanted frequencies are attenuated. Again, this is usually given in dB, and is measured from the highest peak (sidelobe) in the stopband. The attenuation required can differ greatly dependent on the application, from as little as 20dB for some audio applications, to over 80dB for radio systems. \n",
    "- **Transition bandwidth** is the frequency range between the passband and the stopband, and can typically have a big effect on passband ripple and stopband attenuation. The smaller the transition bandwidth, the larger the passband ripple and the lower the stopband attenuation will be. \n",

    "### Phase Response\n",
    "\n",
    "For certain applications, the phase response of a filter is as much an important factor as its magnitude response. Generally, all filters will, in some form, change the phase of the signals passing through it, and dependent on the filter, will change the phase by different amounts at different frequencies. And, because a change in phase is a delay in time, it will not effect the magnitude response of a signal, but rather effect the signal in the time-domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes in phase are less important for things like audio applications where it may be difficult for the human ear to perceive, but can be critical for radio applications where the phase of a signal is used to represent information.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIR filters are preferred for phase-sensitive applications because they are easily constrained to achieve a linear phase response. If a filter exhibits linear phase it means that the shift in phase, relative to each frequency, changes at a constant rate (i.e linearly). Conversely, for non-linear phase filters the phase shift will not be constant between frequencies, hence distorting the shape of the time-domain signals passing through the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "An FIR filter will exhibit linear phase if its impulse response is even or odd symmetrical, or even or odd anti-symmetrical around its centre point. This results in four types of linear phase FIR filters, as shown in the Figure below.\n",

    "Each linear phase filter type has its own characteristics and are used for various applications. Generally, Type I and Type II are the most commonly used. Type I filters (odd number of coefficients and symmetric) are the most universal and can be used for low pass, high pass, bandpass, and bandstop responses. Type II filters (even number of coefficients and symmetric) are more restrictive where, under most cicrcumstances, only low pass and bandpass responses are possible.\n",
    "\n",

    "The Window Method is a popular way to design filters as it is fast, easy to implement, and generally acheives adequete results. The method simply *windows* an ideal impulse response $h_d(n)$ by multiplying it by a window function $w(n)$:\n",

Instead, we have to truncate it to a length that is suitable to the application (the longer the filter, the more calculations are required, and the longer the delay). When we truncate the ideal impulse response though, it causes the filter to behave in undesirable ways. Truncating the ideal impulse response is analogous to multiplying it by a rectangular window.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is for this reason, windows other than the rectangular window are used. Typically, good windows display a tapered response towards zero which helps *smooth* the edges of the truncated impulse response. ```Numpy``` is able to generate a number of the most popular windows, known as General Cosine Windows."

    "\n",
    "The Parks-McClellan algorithm is probably the most widely known and used filter design method. It uses the Remez Exhange algorithm and Chebyshev Approximation to design an optimal filter that minimises the error between the desired (ideal) response and the actual (achieveable) response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beginning and the end of the algorithm is actually identical to the Frequency Sampling method we discussed earlier. You start with a desired frequency response, and end by using the inverse Fourier transform to retrieve the coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm in between these steps calculates a best guess approximation of the desired filter and calculates the maximum error over the entire response. If the error is too large then another guess is made and the algorithm repeats. This goes on until the maximum error has been minimised to an appropriate value.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recognise this as an optimisation technique, and that is because it is! The benefit of using this type of algorithm is that you have significantly more control over the frequency response than you do with the Window Method, most notably, the transition bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major pitfall of this technique though is that it requires convergence (e.g. the error must be continuously minimised). Under certain conditions the error will flucuate wildly and the algorithm will never find an optimal solution, causing the program to run ad infinitum. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can avoid this by adding constraints to the algorithm, for instance by setting a maximum number of iterations to compute, but the resultant filter may not be suitable. Another option is to reduce the constraints on the transition bandwidth by making it wider; again, this may result in an undesireable filter. For these reasons it is always best to check the quality of the filter before applying it to your system.\n",

    "Each method has its pros and cons. The Window Method is fast, easy to compute, and produces filters with frequency responses that are easy to predict. While the Parks McClellan and Least Squares algorithms give much more control over a filter's frequency response, but can take longer to compute and may be difficult to achieve a desired response.\n",
