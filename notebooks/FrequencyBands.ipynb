    "Wireless communications via RF is now an essential part of life for many people. Whether it is wireless network access in offices, mobile basestation backhaul, consumers texting, using voice and video communications or social media, it is likely at some point that they will be communicating over various frequency bands using standards such as Bluetooth, WiFi, GSM, and LTE. Planning and licensing is required in order to set rules about power levels, and ensure that interference does not occur between different broadcasters. In the UK, these frequency planning and licensing tasks fall upon a government approved body called the office of Communications (Ofcom - https://www.ofcom.org.uk/home). The USA has the Federal Communications Commission (FCC - https://www.fcc.gov/); and other countries have their own national agencies. In all countries the RF Spectrum has been split up into a number of defined frequency bands which are allocated to different users and for different application. Generally no two countries are exactly the same in their frequency planning, and there can be considerable differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, in the UK there are currently no mobile phone service frequencies below 800 MHz, whereas in some countries in Eastern Europe, they operate down as low as the 400 MHz UHF band. In recent years there have been efforts via organisations such as the International Telecommunications Union (ITU - https://www.itu.int) to harmonise these bands where possible (particularly in areas where countries have borders). \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of successful harmonisation is WiFi (the IEEE 802.11 standard) which operates on the 2.4 GHz band. FM radio is also pretty standard across most countries, in the 88 MHz to 108 MHz band, and nearly all radio stations are spaced at least 200 KHz apart. When frequenies are harmonised, equipment designed to work in one country will likely work in others; which helps bring costs down. \n",
    "\n",
    "Communications techniques where harmonisation is not as prevalent include mobile standards, with, for example, the USA and Europe using quite distinct frequencies for GSM, UMTS and LTE services. Modern phones are now able to address issues like this adequetly however, by being tri- (or even quad-) band, and having the ability to receive and transmit at various frequencies using different front end RF hardware, which can be switched in and out depending on which country it is being used in.\n",
    "\n",
    "5G will see new allocated frequency bands around the world and in particular the wider use of mm-wave frequencies  (26 GHz and higher). Used frequencies will go well above 32 GHz to 80 GHz and higher."

By the late 80s and early 90s sigma delta technology had arrived with 'oversampling' devices running at low MHz, before decimating down or interpolating up to baseband audio.\n",

    "## RFSoC Advantages for Radio\n",
    "\n",
    "Several of the RFSoC architecture features previously discussed give RFSoC devices an advantage over a traditional multi-chip solution for general radio designs:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Very wide RF bandwidth**: The RFSoC can directly digitise a range of bands. The high sampling rates (and therefore the wide RF bandwidth) supported by the RFSoC is a significant feature. This means that all-digital radios can be designed with minimal external analogue cicuitry, for systems that cover RF bands up to roughly 4 GHz (and beyond, for the most recent RFSoC generations). This is achieved directly for RF bands up to ~2 GHz and by exploiting Nyquist zones for frequencies between ~2 GHz and ~4 GHz. The use of Nyquist zones will be explained later in this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supports different radio architectures**: either all-digital or with digital-to-IF for higher bands, to cover any desired RF frequency band. For instance, very high RF frequency bands can be catered to by integrating external modulation and demodulation to convert between IF and RF. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple Channels**: facilitates sophisticated, MIMO radio designs and enables a single chip to support multiple radios simultaneously. The multiple DAC and ADC channels supported by the RFSoC (8 or 16 of each) means that radio systems for MIMO applications can be developed on a single chip. There is also the potential to implement several radios for different bands and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single chip solution**: eases design effort, especially for interfacing, and enables systems with smaller footprint and lower power operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrated DUC (filtering and modulation) and DDC (demodulation and filtering)**: reduces design effort and required PL resources, and enables lower power consumption. The integrated DUC and DDC can also support higher sampling rates than would be possible on PL. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrated FEC block**: likewise reduces design effort, PL resource consumption, and power usage. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The integration of RF data converters with PL and hardened radio IP blocks is also an advantage for developing radio designs. DUC, DDC, and FEC functionality is commonly required, and it would otherwise need to be implemented in the PL. Particularly in the case of FEC, a considerable amount of PL resources may be needed. Having access to pre-verified and hardened blocks reduces the design effort required, and saves the PL resources that would otherwise be needed to implement them on the PL. It is also notable that the output of the DUC and the input of the DDC operate at the same sampling rates as the RF-DAC and RF-ADC respectively (up to multiple GHz), i.e. much higher rates than could be supported by a DUC and DDC implemented in the PL."

    "## RFSoC Key Features for SDR\n",
    "\n",
    "This section considers aspects of the RFSoC's functionality that are especially beneficial for SDR, i.e. beyond the needs of radio in general (which might have fixed functionality once designed). SDR requires the radio to be dynamic and flexible in its operation, under software control.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Programmable RF sample rate**: caters for different requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High sample rates**: A wide RF bandwidth enables multiple radio bands to be generated/captured simultaneously. Useful for SDR where dynamic operation is required. Flexibility is further extended by the availability of multiple channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Programmable DUC and DDC parameters**: flexible frequency and decimation/interpolation ratios can be programmed from software.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Run-time reprogrammability**: Hardware design (on PL) can be designed to be reprogrammable at run-time, e.g. filter coefficients, operating, etc. Beyond this, the full hardware system can be reprogrammed, and Partial Reconfiguration (PR) can be exploited.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single chip solution**: The integration of PS applications and real-time processors with PL, data converters and FEC block is ideal for close coupling of software control with hardware processing and RF functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The RFSoC provides the means to exert dynamic control over multiple aspects of a radio's functionality. This includes the front end sampling rate and the configuration of the RF data converters, the DUC and DDC behaviour, and also custom modules that may be developed in hardware on the PL. Therefore, the modulation and demodulation frequencies can be dynamically altered, and the behaviour of hardware processing blocks can be controlled from software. Parameters of hardware processing blocks can be altered. Taking this to an extreme, software could also prompt part of or all of the PL to be reprogrammed with a new set of functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The integration of the PS with the hardware elements (PL, data converters, hardened DUC, DDC, and FEC blocks) is particularly significant in this respect. The single chip architecture enables software to reside very close to the hardware that it controls, and therefore the feedback loop is much faster than would be possible with a multi-chip solution."
