    "This series of notebooks will introduce two important processes used in digital systems:\n",
    "**sampling** and **quantisation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nature comprises various energies (e.g. thermal, light, sound, electromagnetic) which can be expressed as electrical signals when appropriately transformed. This process is often performed with a component called a transducer. \n",
    "\n",
    "A microphone is a tranducer which transforms sound energy into electrical energy that can be amplified and then transformed again into sound as it exits your speakers. This is an example of an **analogue** process. That is, the electrical signal is continuous in time and has infinite precision in amplitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **digital** system has limitations in memory and processing power, therefore discretising a signal in time (**sampling**) and amplitude (**quantisation**) is neccessary. By following some rules, we can retain all the requisite information of the analogue signal when converting between the digital and analogue domains. \n",
