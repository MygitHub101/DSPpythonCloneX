The OFDM signal is then passed through a baseband channel model, including multipath channel filter and Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). The receiver stages include CP removal, FFT demodulation, channel estimation and one-tap equalisation. In order to assess the quality of the received signal, we inspect the received constellations before and after equalisation and measure Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). \n",
